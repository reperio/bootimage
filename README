What this is
------------

This source tree is a set of control files that allows you to build a bootable
OS that contains "break-in" testing facilities.

The purpose is to put a system under the absolutely highest amount of load we
can possibly muster. This is required because modern hardware uses highly-
aggressive power-saving features. With the proper BLAS libraries loaded, a
system that previously appeared to be at 100% CPU utilization will suddenly
consume 25% more power--all because the BLAS libraries keep the power-saving
features from turning on.

How this works
--------------

build.sh is the top level control script; you should do everything through it.

We generate a kernel, initrd and an ISO and drop them in dist/

src/ is used as the building directory and stage/ is used to assemble the root
file system that is used by the initramfs.

All of the building done in src/ is controlled by srcctrl/ scripts. Each of
these scripts is called with fetch, unpack, build and install successively from
build.sh

build.sh currently takes three parameters:

  -a will disable the building of AMD HPL (this is here because ACML is very,
     very pickey about which GCC versions it will build with)
  -g will disabled ACML and MKL in favor of the highly restrictive GotoBLAS
     implementation. If you opt to go this route, you will have to build your
     own copies of this library and place them in src/ as libgoto_intel32.a,
     libgoto_intel64.a, libgoto_amd32.a and libgoto_amd64.a
  -c [parms] will pass these parameters to any ./configure scripts used to make
     initramfs binaries

Dependencies
------------

In addition the general developer utilities used to build FOSS, you will need
the following specific libraries and tools installed:

  * nasm (for syslinux)
  * flex (for lm-sensors)
  * libsysfs-dev (for edac-utils)
  * libuuid-dev (for parted)
  * libdevmapper-dev (for LVM)
  * gfortran-4.2 (required to build AMD ACML-4.1-based HPL)
  * mkisofs

We have confirmed that this tree builds on CentOS/RHEL 5.2 (with GCC-4.2 
installed from source), Ubuntu Hardy (with mapper-foo from Intrepid), and Debian
Lenny.

On RH-based distro's you'll want to install the giant "Development" yum task.
On Debian-based, install "build-essential".

src/linux*/
-----------
We pull the latest snapshot of the edac patches from SVN and quilt them in to
the kernel source tree so that the AMD and latest Intel motherboards have error
reporting facilities in the breakin UI.

Note that EDAC only works with ECC and FB-DIMM memory.


src/bootimage-initfs/etc/startup.sh
----------------------------------
 *  This script handles the dispatching of the various features the 
    startup=<NAME> kernel argument will cause the script to execute 
    /etc/<NAME>/startup.sh
 *  any kernel command line argument is available to you by sourcing
    the file /tmp/cmdline.dat - to prevent namespace clobbering all variables
    are name _variable (i.e. _image).

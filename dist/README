This tarball contains a kernel and initrd suitable for use for netbooting
Breakin. On a netboot-configured server, you can copy these files to your
tftpboot directory and modify your server to serve these files.

To configure a netboot server, follow the following outline.

In examples/ you'll find a few example config files:

file            install path            purpose
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default         /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg  Provide a boot menu to network clients
tftp            /etc/xinetd.d           Enable the tftp server
dhcpd.conf      /etc                    Simple configuration of DHCPv3 server

You'll need to install a tftpserver, ISC's DHCPv3 server, and an inetd service
provider (like xinetd).

If you install syslinux, you'll obtain the needed pxelinux.0 and menu.c32 files
that need to be installed to /tftpboot--typically these can be found in
/usr/share/syslinux.

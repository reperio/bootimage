This tarball contains a kernel and initrd suitable for use for netbooting
Breakin. On a netboot-configured server, you can copy these files to your
tftpboot directory and modify your server to serve these files.

To configure a netboot server, follow the following outline.

In examples/ you'll find a few example config files:

file            install path            purpose
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default         /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg  Provide a boot menu to network clients
tftp            /etc/xinetd.d           Enable the tftp server
dhcpd.conf      /etc                    Simple configuration of DHCPv3 server

You'll need to install a tftpserver, ISC's DHCPv3 server, and an inetd service
provider (like xinetd).

If you install your distro's syslinux package, you'll obtain the needed
pxelinux.0 and menu.c32 files that need to be installed to /tftpboot--typically
these can be found in /usr/share/syslinux. We cannot distribute these binaries
without also including a copy of syslinux in this tarball.

So, after you have installed the three (3) provided config. files, found and
installed syslinux's pxelinux.0 and menu.c32, and installed the kernel and
initrd our filesystem will have new files in:

/tftpboot/bootimage/kernel-3.0
/tftpboot/bootimage/initrd-v3.0.cpio.gz
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default
/tftpboot/pxelinux.0
/tftpboot/menu.c32
/etc/xinetd.d/tftp
/etc/dhcpd.conf

(Note that on some distro's, the dhcpd.conf goes in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf,
instead.)

# This script will enter modules/ and run every script there with:
# 'fetch', 'unpack', and 'build' successively
#
# If a module needs to do the install to STAGEDIR itself, that should be done
# inside of make_new_initrd in the TOPDIR
#

##
# FETCH
#

for file in modules/*; do
  ${file} fetch
done

##
# UNPACK
#

for file in modules/*; do
  ${file} unpack
done

##
# BUILD
